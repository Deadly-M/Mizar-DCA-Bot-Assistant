# MizarAssistant
Node.js code, To setup on a Ubuntu console you will need to have installed "nodejs" and then node package manager "npm" and with that "axios"

** Tested (10X / Cross / Long) only ** 

Monitors Mizar DCA positions and boosts the take profit depending on safety order depth.

Works best in sideways and bullish markets

Gives you a bit of extra time to hold open trades that look like their going to pump

This also helps a bit to fight the mizar fees.

Planing to add trailing option with a TA exit such as RSIcrossunder or EMAconvergance
.
Also want to allow additional positions to open when existing ones are safe with a green stoploss (I can't figure out how to achieve this, HELP!)

Probably wont develop this much more as the fees on the platform seem to have already exceeded a what a 3commas subscription would cost!!!!
